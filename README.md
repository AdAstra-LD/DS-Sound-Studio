# DS-Sound-Studio
This is an attempt to fix the issues with Gericom's DS Sound Studio program. 

### Fixes
- Program no longer crashes when trying to play some sounds.

### To Fix/Add
- Playing two songs at the same time writes to the same buffer - which effectively causes unintelligble sound.
- Some songs do not play correctly for various reasons.
- Some features of the program do not work (lacking implementation).
- (Potentially) Port to .NET Core and make it cross-platform.
